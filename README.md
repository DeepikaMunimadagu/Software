# 📚 Library Management System

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This project is designed to help manage books, authors, and issued books in a library setting efficiently. It's perfect for both academic and public libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- **Category Management**: Organize books into categories such as novels, computer science, motivational books, etc.
- **User Management**: Users can register, log in, and check out books. Admins can manage users.
- **Issued Books**: Keep track of books issued to users, including return dates and overdue books.
  
## 📑 Database Structure

The project uses a **SQL database** with the following key tables:
1. **Admins**: Stores admin details.
2. **Authors**: Keeps information about authors.
3. **Books**: Stores details about books and links them to categories and authors.
4. **Categories**: Book classification such as genre or subject.
5. **Issued Books**: Tracks which user has borrowed which book.
6. **Users**: Registered users who can borrow books.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Backend**: MySQL for database management.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if applicable).
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for code management.
